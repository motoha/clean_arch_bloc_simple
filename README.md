You don't have to follow clean architecture on every Flutter project. Whether to use clean architecture depends on several factors:

1. Project Complexity
- For small to medium-sized projects with simple logic, clean architecture might be overkill
- It introduces additional complexity and boilerplate code
- Simple apps can be developed effectively with a more straightforward approach

2. When to Consider Clean Architecture
- Large, complex projects with multiple features
- Projects expected to scale significantly
- Applications with complex business logic
- Projects requiring high testability and maintainability
- Enterprise or long-term maintained applications

3. Pros of Clean Architecture
- Separation of concerns
- Easier to test
- More modular and flexible
- Easier to modify and extend
- Better code organization

4. Cons of Clean Architecture
- Increased initial development time
- More files and folders to manage
- Steeper learning curve
- Potential over-engineering for simple projects

5. Alternatives
- Provider pattern for state management
- BLoC pattern
- MVC (Model-View-Controller)
- Simple folder structure based on features

Recommendation: Assess your project's specific requirements, team expertise, and long-term goals before deciding to implement clean architecture. Start simple and introduce complexity only when necessary.
